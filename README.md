# Intellident

**Intellident** is an innovative dental app designed to assist dentists and patients by automatically detecting dental diseases from images of the patient's jaw. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the app currently identifies the following conditions:

- **Spaces between teeth**: Detects gaps or abnormal spacing between teeth.
- **Dental Cavities**: Identifies areas of decay or cavities in the teeth.
- **Dental Stains**: Detects discoloration or staining on the teeth.
- **Dental Calculus**: Identifies hardened plaque, commonly known as tartar, on the teeth.

## Features

- **Automated Disease Detection**: Simply upload an image of the patient's jaw, and the app will analyze it to detect any potential issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React Native, Intellident provides a seamless experience on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Robust Backend**: Powered by Spring Boot, the app ensures reliable performance and efficient data handling.
- **Integrated Deep Learning Model**: The app uses a trained deep learning model to accurately identify dental diseases.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework that handles the server-side logic.
- **YOLO-V8**: Integrated with the app to process images and detect dental diseases.

## Walkthrough
- Folder names are quite intutive, React Native frontend resides in the frontend folder, backend in the backend and model weights in the model folder
